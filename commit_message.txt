feat(monetization): implement in-app purchases and premium features

This commit introduces a comprehensive monetization system to the Snake Classic game.

Key features include:
- In-app currency (Snake Coins) for purchasing items.
- A dedicated store to buy themes, cosmetics, and power-ups.
- Premium subscription ("Snake Classic Pro") with exclusive benefits like new game modes and larger board sizes.
- Seasonal Battle Pass with tiered rewards.
- Backend purchase verification for security.
- UI updates across the app to integrate and promote the new monetization features.

This lays the groundwork for the game's economy and provides players with more ways to customize their experience.
