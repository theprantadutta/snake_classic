```

## 3. Component Architecture

### 3.1 Game Models

#### Snake Model
```dart
class Snake {
  List<Offset> body = [Offset(5, 5), Offset(4, 5), Offset(3, 5)];
  Direction direction = Direction.right;
  bool isGrowing = false;
  
  void move() {
    // Add new head in current direction
    // Remove tail unless growing
  }
  
  void grow() {
    isGrowing = true;
  }
  
  bool checkSelfCollision() {
    // Check if head collides with any body part
  }
}
```
- Represents the snake as a list of positions
- Manages movement direction and speed
- Handles growth mechanics
- Detects self-collision

#### Food Model
```dart
class Food {
  Offset position = Offset(10, 10);
  
  void generateNewPosition(List<Offset> snakeBody, int gridSize) {
    // Generate random position not on snake body
  }
  
  bool isConsumed(Offset snakeHead) {
    return position == snakeHead;
  }
}
```
- Generates random positions within the grid
- Ensures food doesn't spawn on snake body
- Manages special food types (for future enhancements)

#### Game State Model
```dart
class GameState {
  int score = 0;
  int highScore = 0;
  GameStatus status = GameStatus.notStarted;
  int gameSpeed = 200; // milliseconds
  
  void updateScore(int points) {
    score += points;
    if (score > highScore) {
      highScore = score;
    }
  }
  
  void increaseDifficulty() {
    // Increase speed as score increases
  }
}

enum GameStatus { notStarted, playing, paused, gameOver }
```
- Tracks current score and high score
- Manages game status (playing, paused, game over)
- Controls game speed and difficulty progression

### 3.2 UI Components

#### Home Screen
```dart
HomeScreen(
  title: "Snake Game",
  highScore: 1250,
  onPlayPressed: () {},
  onSettingsPressed: () {},
)
```
- Animated title with snake-themed graphics
- Play button with hover effects and ripple animations
- High score display with trophy icon
- Theme selection cards
- Settings access button

#### Game Screen
```dart
GameScreen(
  gridSize: 20,
  score: 250,
  onDirectionChanged: (direction) {},
  onPausePressed: () {},
)
```
- Grid-based game board with custom painter (20x20 cells)
- Animated snake rendering with gradient colors
- Particle effects for food consumption
- Score display with animations at top
- Pause functionality with overlay menu
- Direction controls (swipe gestures and on-screen buttons)

#### Game Over Screen
```dart
GameOverScreen(
  score: 250,
  highScore: 1250,
  isNewHighScore: false,
  onRestartPressed: () {},
  onMenuPressed: () {},
)
```
- Score summary with animations
- High score update notification with celebration effect
- Restart and menu options with icon buttons
- Share score functionality with social media integration

### 3.3 Game Board Widget
```
GameBoard
├── CustomPaint (grid background)
├── SnakeWidget (animated snake)
├── FoodWidget (animated food)
└── ParticleSystem (consumption effects)
```

## 4. State Management

The application will use the Provider pattern for state management:

### GameProvider
- Manages game state transitions
- Handles user input processing
- Controls game loop timing
- Coordinates UI updates

### State Flow
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> HomeScreen
    HomeScreen --> GameScreen: Start Game
    GameScreen --> Paused: Pause
    Paused --> GameScreen: Resume
    GameScreen --> GameOver: Game Over
    GameOver --> GameScreen: Restart
    GameOver --> HomeScreen: Menu
```

## 5. UI/UX Design

### 5.1 Visual Design

#### Color Themes
```dart
enum GameTheme {
  retro(
    name: "Retro",
    snakeColor: Color(0xFF00FF00),
    foodColor: Color(0xFFFF0000),
    backgroundColor: Color(0xFF000000),
    gridColor: Color(0xFF004400),
  ),
  neon(
    name: "Neon",
    snakeColor: Color(0xFF00FFFF),
    foodColor: Color(0xFFFF00FF),
    backgroundColor: Color(0xFF220022),
    gridColor: Color(0xFF440044),
  ),
  dark(
    name: "Dark",
    snakeColor: Color(0xFF44BB44),
    foodColor: Color(0xFFBB4444),
    backgroundColor: Color(0xFF111111),
    gridColor: Color(0xFF333333),
  ),
  light(
    name: "Light",
    snakeColor: Color(0xFF228822),
    foodColor: Color(0xFF882222),
    backgroundColor: Color(0xFFFFFFFF),
    gridColor: Color(0xFFEEEEEE),
  );
}
```
- **Retro Theme**: Green snake on black background with CRT scanlines
- **Neon Theme**: Vibrant glowing snake with dark background
- **Dark Theme**: Subtle colors with dark mode optimization
- **Light Theme**: Clean and minimal design

#### Animations
- Smooth snake movement with interpolation using Tween animations
- Food consumption particle effects with random trajectories
- Score counter animations with scaling and color transitions
- Screen transitions with fade/zoom effects
- Snake head rotation based on direction changes
- Grid cell highlighting when snake passes through

### 5.2 Controls

#### Touch Controls
```dart
// Swipe detection using GestureDetector
SwipeControls({
  onSwipeUp: () {},
  onSwipeDown: () {},
  onSwipeLeft: () {},
  onSwipeRight: () {},
})

// Directional buttons with icon buttons
DirectionalButtons({
  onUpPressed: () {},
  onDownPressed: () {},
  onLeftPressed: () {},
  onRightPressed: () {},
})
```
- Swipe gestures for direction changes with velocity detection
- On-screen directional buttons for precise control with haptic feedback
- Pause button overlay with animated icon

#### Responsiveness
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes
- Dynamic grid sizing based on device dimensions
- Touch target optimization for small devices

## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 Game Loop
```dart
// Game loop using Ticker for smooth animations
class GameLoop extends ChangeNotifier {
  late Ticker _ticker;
  Duration _lastUpdateTime = Duration.zero;
  Duration _gameSpeed = Duration(milliseconds: 200);
  
  void start() {
    _ticker = Ticker((elapsed) {
      if (elapsed - _lastUpdateTime > _gameSpeed) {
        updateGameState();
        _lastUpdateTime = elapsed;
        notifyListeners();
      }
    });
    _ticker.start();
  }
  
  void updateGameState() {
    // Move snake in current direction
    // Check for collisions
    // Check for food consumption
    // Update score
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Rendering
- CustomPainter for grid and snake rendering
- AnimatedBuilder for smooth animations
- Tween animations for position interpolation

### 6.3 Direction Handling
```dart
enum Direction { up, down, left, right }

// Direction change with validation to prevent 180-degree turns
class DirectionController {
  static Direction? validateDirectionChange(Direction current, Direction next) {
    if ((current == Direction.up && next == Direction.down) ||
        (current == Direction.down && next == Direction.up) ||
        (current == Direction.left && next == Direction.right) ||
        (current == Direction.right && next == Direction.left)) {
      return null; // Invalid direction change
    }
    return next;
  }
}
```

### 6.3 Data Persistence
- SharedPreferences for high score storage
- JSON serialization for settings persistence

## 7. Performance Considerations

- Efficient CustomPainter implementation
- Object pooling for particle effects
- Optimized game loop with frame rate control
- Lazy loading of assets and resources

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests
```dart
// Test snake movement in all directions
test('Snake moves right correctly', () {
  // ...
});

// Test collision detection
test('Snake detects self collision', () {
  // ...
});

// Test food generation
test('Food generates not on snake', () {
  // ...
});
```
- Snake movement logic in all directions
- Collision detection algorithms (wall and self)
- Food generation and positioning (not on snake)
- Score calculation and high score updates

### 8.2 Widget Tests
```dart
// Test UI rendering
void main() {
  testWidgets('Home screen displays correctly', (tester) async {
    // ...
  });
}
```
- UI component rendering (Home, Game, GameOver screens)
- User interaction handling (swipe, buttons, pause)
- State transitions (start, pause, game over)
- Theme switching and visual updates

### 8.3 Integration Tests
```dart
// Test complete game flow
void main() {
  testWidgets('Complete game flow test', (tester) async {
    // ...
  });
}
```
- Complete game flow (start, play, game over, restart)
- High score persistence across sessions
- Settings preservation (theme, controls)
- Performance under different device conditions

## 9. Future Enhancements

### 9.1 Planned Features
```dart
// Difficulty levels
enum Difficulty {
  easy(speed: 300),
  medium(speed: 200),
  hard(speed: 100);
}

// Sound effects
SoundManager {
  playChompSound();
  playCrashSound();
  playBackgroundMusic();
}
```
- Multiple difficulty levels with speed variations
- Sound effects and background music with volume control
- Power-ups (slow motion, double points, extra life)
- Leaderboard integration with Firebase

### 9.2 Advanced Features
- Multiplayer mode (split-screen or online)
- Maze mode with obstacles and walls
- Custom snake skins and food themes
- Achievement system with badges and rewards
- Daily challenges and special events
