## 🐍 Classic Snake in Flutter — Blueprint

### 🎯 Core Gameplay

* Snake moves automatically in a grid (like 20x20 tiles).
* Player swipes (or taps arrows) to change direction: **up, down, left, right**.
* Snake grows by 1 tile every time it eats food.
* Game over if:

  * Snake hits the wall.
  * Snake hits itself.

### 🛠 MVP Features

1. **Game Board**

   * Grid-based, rendered with `GridView` or `CustomPainter`.
   * Snake body = list of coordinates (e.g., `List<Offset>`).
   * Food = single coordinate.

2. **Movement Loop**

   * Use a `Timer.periodic(Duration(milliseconds: speed))`.
   * Each tick moves snake head in current direction.
   * Update snake body list (add new head, remove last tail).

3. **Food Logic**

   * Randomly generate food position (not overlapping snake).
   * If snake eats → grow snake (don’t remove tail that tick).

4. **Collision Detection**

   * Check if head hits wall.
   * Check if head matches any body tile (self-collision).

5. **Score System**

   * +1 per food eaten.
   * High score saved in local storage (`shared_preferences`).

### ✨ Nice-to-Have Features

* **Levels / Difficulty** → speed increases as you grow.
* **Themes** → retro green-on-black, neon, emoji snake 🐍🍎.
* **Controls** → support both swipes & on-screen arrow buttons.
* **Pause/Resume** → with overlay menu.
* **Sound Effects** → chomp, crash, game over music.
* **Leaderboard** → Firebase integration (optional).

### 📱 UI Flow

1. **Home Screen**

   * Play button
   * High Score display
   * Settings (themes, controls)

2. **Game Screen**

   * Grid with snake + food
   * Current score at top
   * Pause button

3. **Game Over Screen**

   * Final score
   * High score update if beaten
   * Restart / Back to menu

### 🔧 Tech Notes

* **Rendering Snake**:

  * Each cell = `Container` or `CustomPaint` rect.
  * Snake body can be drawn as colored squares.

* **Game Loop**:

  * `Timer.periodic` is simplest, but you could also use a `Ticker` for smoother animations.

* **Direction Handling**:

  ```dart
  enum Direction { up, down, left, right }
  Direction currentDirection = Direction.right;
  ```

* **Growing Snake**:

  ```dart
  snake.insert(0, newHead); 
  if (ateFood) { /* don’t remove tail */ } else { snake.removeLast(); }
  ```

---

### 🚀 Possible Future Expansions

* Multiplayer (two snakes on same board, split food).
* Power-ups (slow motion, teleport, double points).
* Maze mode (walls inside the board).
* Endless arena (snake wraps around edges instead of dying).

So your MVP can be:
✅ Snake that moves + grows
✅ Food spawning
✅ Score tracking
✅ Game over conditions

Then layer the extra features gradually.
